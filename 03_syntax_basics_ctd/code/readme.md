## Ascii Art Exercises Ctd


### 1 Exercise 

Add structure and readability to your application; work together with your team mate.

- Add two new files to your project:
  - ascii.cpp
  - ascii.h
- Move all functionalities that are related to the ascii-art to these files. 
- Re-arrange the functions in such a way that the main.cpp only contains the main function. #
- Make sure that you do not use global variables! See also [why they should be avoided](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/why-non-const-global-variables-are-evil/) in most cases.
- Review the functions according to the following:
  - functions do one thing and one thing only
  - function names should be comprehensible and describe what the function is doing

Review in class.
