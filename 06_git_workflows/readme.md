# Git Workflows

In this session of Creative Coding II, we will take a small detour to recap and review Git. In particular, we will do several exercises to illustrate and understand the different concepts of Git's version control, such as

- the difference between HEAD, main, origin/main, and remotes/origin/main
- how to branch off and merge back in
- the difference between staging and commits
- Github Desktop vs Git in VSCode vs Git on the command line
- Git log and git history 

## Exercises

Exercises will be presented and conducted in class. For an additional exercise, fork the newly created Snake Game branch
