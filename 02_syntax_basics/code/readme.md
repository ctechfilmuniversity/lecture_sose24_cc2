## Ascii Art Exercises

### 1 Exercise

Familiarize yourselves with the code examples.

Check out the six different source code files in the ascii art folder, compile them one after the other and make sure you understand the code. Note down any questions. 

In class we will look into specific new functions and features that come with the examples such as reading and writing a *.txt file with CPP as well as learning about variables, types, and functions. 

--- 

### 2 Exercise

Combine all functionalities in one application. 

- Note down the individual functionalities that come with the different projects and group them in meaningful components (conceptual step). 
- Setup a new command line application project in XCode or MS Visual Studio Community (the project will contain a main.cpp file)
- Move all functions and functionalities to that main.cpp file
- Compile and build the application
- Re-structure the main function such that it allows to 
  - read in an ascii file and print it or 
  - print the blinking eye ascii art

Review in class.

### 3 Exercise 

Add structure and readability to your application; work together with your team mate.

- Add two new files to your project:
  - ascii.cpp
  - ascii.h
- Move all functionalities that are related to the ascii-art to these files. 
- Re-arrange the functions in such a way that the main.cpp only contains the main function. #
- Make sure that you do not use global variables! See also [why they should be avoided](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/why-non-const-global-variables-are-evil/) in most cases.
- Review the functions according to the following:
  - functions do one thing and one thing only
  - function names should be comprehensible and describe what the function is doing

Review in class.

### 4 Exercise / Homework Assignment

Discuss with your team mate how to turn this application in a more creative application. 

- Conceive and implement an own idea.
- Use GitHub as a development tool in your team (advanced and TBD in class)
