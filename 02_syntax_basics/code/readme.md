# Code Examples

The current directory contains the following content: 

- 01_ascii_art folder: an exercise
- examples folder: coding examples for you to check out 
- solutions folder: solutions to the last homework assignment

## Ascii Art Exercises

### 1 Exercise

Please check out the six different source code files in the ascii art folder, compile them one after the other and make sure you understand the code. Note down any questions. In class we will look into specific new functions and features that come with the examples such as reading and writing a *.txt file with CPP as well as learning about this class objectives. 

### 2 Exercise

Note down the different functionalities that come with the different examples (printing to cli, reading & writing files, animating an ascii art, etc.). Now think about how an application could work that contains all functionalities in one application. Discuss with your team mate(s) how this application should function and how it could be implemented. 

### 3 Exercise 

Create a new main.cpp file that contains one main function only. Move the rest of the functionality, all function declarations and function definitions to an ascii.h and ascii.cpp file. In main, create a sequence of function calls that are like a narrative and describe exactly what is happening in your application. Implement the application.

### 4 Exercise

Add the application to your Github's team repo.
