## GitHub Exercise

In class, we will dive into team work and how to use Github, git branching and merging for this. Therefore, please `fork` and use this repository 

https://github.com/abrennec/cc2_snake_game_dev/

We will work on this together in class.

## Snake Game Exercise

### Basic Snake Game 

- In your team, pull the repository and build the ofApp with the help of the ProjectGenerator. Do not look into the code in detail, check out what is happening. How could this be implemented? Discuss and take notes.
- Now, review the code. Which parts seem to be logical, which parts are surprising to you?
- Review and improve the code
  - Are the access specifiers correct?
  - Do all data members well defined and well designed, i.e. think about the scl (cellSize) member, does it really belong to the respective classes? 
  - Are there any visual improvements that you would like to implement?

In your teams, create branches per developer and distribute the tasks. Work on your branches and merge every improvement back into the main branch using the technique of a pull request. Decide who will take care of resolving the pull request. 

### Snake Game Ctd.
