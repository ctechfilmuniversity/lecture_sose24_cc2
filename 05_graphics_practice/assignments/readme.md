# Assignments

You need 10 assignment pts in total to collect 50% of the course pts and to pass the course. You can collect 3 pts per assignment sheet.

## 1 Assignment - Recap

Each team, read the script and additional materials. Note down any questions that came up during recapping the material and lectures. Use learncpp.com or other suggested reading materials to find answers to your questions. Discuss with your team mate and bring open questions to the next class.


## 2 Assignment - Exercises 1 pts

In your teams, continue to finalize the exercises presented in sessions 4 and 5, respectively:

- [Exercise 4](../../04_openFrameworks/code/readme.md)
- [Exercise 5](../code/visual_exercise.md)


## 2 Assignment - Creativity | 2 pts

In your teams, decide to work on one of the following subtasks:

### 2.1 Expand an ofApp from one of the exercises

Continue to develop a creative and fun to use ofApp. Base it on your learnings so far and use the application exercises as a basis for new ideas. Specify the following in bullet points either in the code or as a separate *md file:

- How should the application work? 
- What components will be part of it? 
- Think about how to use a data type like a `struct` (or `class`) in your application. 

**Focus**: Coding practice.

### 2.1 Expand one of the openFrameworks examples

Pick one of the openFrameworks examples that excites you most and review the code. Comment in the code what is happening and note down which parts of the code you do not understand.

In your team, define a feature or extension that you would like to add or that you would like to change the existing example with. Try to implement it. Specify the following in bullet points either in the code or as a separate *md file:
- How should the application work? 
- What components will be part of it?  
- Would it make sense to use a data type like a `struct` (or `class`) in your application? 


**Focus**: Understanding new code.
