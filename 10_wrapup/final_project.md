# Final Project CC2

* **Final assignment**: The final assignment will be the development of an interactive AV C++ application that uses the techniques and concepts presented during the lecture. The application can be an extension of a class project/homework assignment or an individual idea (suggestions will be presented at the end of the lecture). You can collect **12 points in total** for the final assignment. The application should show that you can 
  * translate a concept into an object oriented design and implementation
  * understand how to use and work with types
  * understand different levels of abstraction in code as well as in writing code
* **Requirements and general distribution of points**:
    * Object-oriented system design (2 pts)
    * Use of an SDK (i.e., openFrameworks) (2 pt)
    * Code must be clean, application must built and run (2 pts)
    * Implementation of an own artistic idea or a pre-defined task (2 pts)
    * Documentation (2 pts)
      * Written description (md-file)
      * Video trailer (mp4, 30-90 secs max)
    * Quality (2 pts)
* **Submission deadline**: 30th September '24 -- For late submissions, the total points will be reduced by 15%.
* **Scope and Teamwork:** If you would like to implement your own game, you can send me a short outline of what you want to develop until 31 July for feedback. If you would like to work in a team, please let me know whom you will work with and make sure that every team member's work can be distinguished (i.e., via use of Git branches and in the documentation).


## Suggestions

The following subsections contain suggestions for a final project that you could pick up or take inspiration from. 


### Extend the Snake Game 

Extend the snake game by a proper food-snake-interaction concept; i.e., conceive different types of food that interact with the snake and cause different types of snake behavior. Come up with a corresponding object-oriented design concept. 

To further extend the game and or implement it in a group, conceive specific game effects that occur when the snake is moving arround. For instance, check out one of the demo examples listed below and think about an integration.

### De-/Encryption

There are several simple de-/encrpytion examples availabe to start programming in C++, i.e., the following example by [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encrypt-and-decrypt-text-file-using-cpp/).

Conceive an interesting concept that integrates an de-/encryption routine in an interactive AV application. For instance, check out one of the demo examples listed below and think about an integration.

### WAV File 

Check out the [WAVE file programming tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHqkeLxAsTc) as a basis for an implementation. Conceive an interactive AV application that uses the main algorithm in an interactive form.

### Extend Demo Examples

Check out the examples folder of openFrameworks or get inspired by the [web examples](https://openframeworks.cc/examples/).
